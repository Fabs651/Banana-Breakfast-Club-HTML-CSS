**Date of creation:** 05/2024
In this solo project, I created from scratch a [cookbook website](https://fabs651.github.io/Banana-Breakfast-Club-HTML-CSS) using HTML and CSS. A GTM container was also included in the script.
## Navigation
It is possible to navigate the website via:
 - The call to action on the homepage
 - The navigation bar
 - The banana on the left which works as "Return to Home" button
